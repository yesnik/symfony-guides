# Notifier

Current web applications use many different channels to send messages to the users (e.g. SMS, Slack messages, emails, push notifications, etc.). 
The [Notifier](https://symfony.com/doc/current/notifier.html) component in Symfony is an abstraction on top of all these channels.

```bash
composer require symfony/notifier
```
